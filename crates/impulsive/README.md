# impulsive crate (planned)

Placeholder for the impulsive transfer planners (Hohmann, Lambert grids, porkchop sampling).

## TODO
- Extract impulsive planner logic from `src/mission` and `src/bin/porkchop`.
- Implement reusable APIs that return typed Î”v budgets and constraint diagnostics.
- Add porkchop grid exporters and integration tests once the crate is populated.
