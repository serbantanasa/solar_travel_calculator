# lowthrust crate (planned)

Reserved for continuous-thrust propagation, transcription, and guidance strategies.

## TODO
- Move the symmetric accelerate/decelerate integrator and future DP8(7) solver here.
- Introduce throttle scheduling traits shared by propulsion models.
- Provide regression tests leveraging reference SEP and fusion trajectories.
