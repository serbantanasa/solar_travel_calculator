# propulsion crate (planned)

Will host reusable engine and power models (chemical, SEP, fusion) consumed by impulsive and low-thrust planners.

## TODO
- Encode propulsion envelopes with unit-checked types.
- Provide shared mass-flow/throttle helpers for other crates.
- Document references and validation datasets for each engine family.
