# orbits crate (planned)

Future home for parking-orbit builders, patched-conic helpers, and Lambert wrappers.

## TODO
- Migrate orbit construction code from the monolithic crate.
- Provide strongly typed orbit descriptors that integrate with `solar_core` units.
- Add regression tests covering canonical escape/capture cases.
