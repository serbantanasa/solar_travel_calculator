# Solar Travel Calculator

This project explores brachistochrone-style optimal trajectories within the Solar System. The goal is to build a calculator that determines minimum-time transfer paths between planetary bodies while accounting for realistic mission constraints.

## Project Vision
- Model the classical brachistochrone problem for interplanetary travel.
- Incorporate solar gravity and planetary orbits to assess real mission feasibility.
- Provide an interactive interface for configuring origin, destination, and mission parameters.

## Early Objectives
1. Define the mathematical model and underlying assumptions.
2. Prototype numerical solvers for the governing equations.
3. Validate solutions against known optimal trajectories or benchmark datasets.

## Contributing
Development is just beginningâ€”feel free to open issues or propose enhancements as the modeling and tooling take shape.
